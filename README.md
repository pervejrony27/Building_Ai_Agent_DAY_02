# Unit 2 – Agent Tools & Interoperability with MCP

This repository contains the work completed for **Unit 2: Agent Tools & Interoperability with Model Context Protocol (MCP)** as part of the AI Agent Codelab series.  
The focus of this unit is learning how to extend agent capabilities using tools, integrate Model Context Protocol (MCP), and handle long-running operations.

---

## Overview

In this unit:

- Understand how agents use **tools** to perform actions beyond language outputs.  
- Learn how **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** enables interoperability and communication between tools and agents.  
- Explore best practices for designing reliable, flexible, and scalable agent tools.  
- Work through Kaggle codelabs that teach how to add new tools and manage long-running operations.

## Unit 2 Tasks

### 1. Learning Materials
- Listen to the summary podcast for this unit (created using **NotebookLM**).
- Read the whitepaper: **“Agent Tools & Interoperability with Model Context Protocol (MCP)”**.

### 2. Practical Codelabs (Kaggle)

- **Extend agent capabilities with custom tools**  
  Learn how to add new functionality to agents through tool definitions and integrations.

- **Best practices with MCP & long-running operations**  
  Explore how MCP helps manage tool communication and how to correctly implement tools that take time to complete.

---

## Optional: Interactive Exploration
For a deeper understanding, upload the whitepaper to **NotebookLM** to have an interactive conversation and ask questions directly.

## Outcomes
By completing Unit 2, you will be able to:
- Build agents with **extended tool capabilities**
- Use **MCP** to connect agents with external systems
- Design tools that support long-running or asynchronous operations
- Improve interoperability between agents and their environment
